#### What is it?
* It's consisted of nodes and connections
* A node is called a vertex in Graph
* A connection is called edge

### Types
* Undirected Graph - two-way connection such as Facebook
* Undirected - One-way connection such as Instagram with celebrity not following its fans
* Weighted/Unweighted - i.e Google Maps with shortest distance

### Storage
* List or Matrix
* Matrix: takes more space but faster lookup for edges
* List: takes less space and it has more real-world application i.e. social network in which the graph data is sparse and not many connections
